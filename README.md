# kotlin-basics
This repo is to learn basics of Kotlin

Use `fun` to define a function.  
Use `var` to define a variable whose value may change.  
Use `val` to define a value whose value will stay the same.  
You create an array using the `arrayOf()` function.   
A variable holds a reference to an object.  
Kotlin has a number of basic types: `Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double, Boolean, Char and String`  

 *In Java, numbers are primitives, so a variable holds the actual number. Is that not the case with Kotlin?*   
`No, itâ€™s not. In Kotlin, numbers are objects, and the variable holds a reference to the object, not the object itself.`
